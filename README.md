# Real, Random Address Data (RRAD)

This is a list of real, random addresses that geocode successfully (tested on Google's Geocoding API service).
The address data comes from the [OpenAddresses](https://openaddresses.io/) project, and all the addresses are in the public domain.  The
addresses are deliberately not linked to people or businesses; the only guarantee is that they are real addresses that
geocode successfully.

The addresses were pulled from OpenAddress where the "Required attribute" field was present and not "Yes".  See "Attribution" below for a list of sources (also included in each data file).

## Usage

The data is packaged into randomly-ordered files of varying sizes:

| Filename                      | Address Count   | Size    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------:| -------:|
| addresses-us-all.json         | 3,220           | 969k    |
| addresses-us-all.min.json     | 3,220           | 493k    |
| addresses-us-1000.json        | 1,000           | 304k    |
| addresses-us-1000.min.json    | 1,000           | 155k    |
| addresses-us-500.json         |   500           | 154k    |
| addresses-us-500.min.json     |   500           |  79k    |
| addresses-us-250.json         |   250           |  79k    |
| addresses-us-250.min.json     |   250           |  41k    |
| addresses-us-100.json         |   100           |  34k    |
| addresses-us-100.min.json     |   100           |  18k    |

Each package is an object with two properites, `addresses` and `attribution`.  `addresses` is an array of addresses, each of with
with the form:

    {
        "address1": "203 East Gwinnett Street",
        "address2": "",
        "city": "Savannah",
        "state": "GA",
        "postalCode": "31401",
        "coordinates": {
            "lat": 32.06637,
            "lng": -81.093895
        }
    },

For example, to get a random address:

    const addresses = require('./rrad/addresses-us-all.min.json').addresses
    const randomAddress = addresses[Math.floor(Math.random() * addresses.length)]

You may also install this package via npm, though it is a large package since it contains all the data sets.  Usage:

    npm install --save-dev rrad

Or

    yarn add -D rrad

Then, to get a random address:

    const rrad = require('rrad')
    const randomAddress = rrad.addresses[Math.floor(Math.random() * rrad.addresses.length)]
